# Simple Weather App

**Technologies to Learn (Assuming Basic Familiarity):**

1. **Vue.js**: Have a basic understanding of Vue.js and its components.

2. **Django**: Familiarize yourself with Django, especially models, views, and APIs.

3. **MongoDB**: Learn how to set up and interact with MongoDB using Django.

4. **HTML and CSS**: Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS for building the user interface.



**Preparation:**

- **Set up Django Backend**: Have a Django project and app ready to go.
- **Get MongoDB Ready**: Ensure you have MongoDB installed and Django configured to use it via the "djongo" library.

**Steps to Create a Weather Application (Simplified):**

**1. Vue.js Frontend (40 minutes):**

   - Create a new Vue.js project.
   - Build a simple user interface with input fields for location and a display area for weather information.
   - Implement Vue components to manage user input and display weather data.
   - Use Vue's built-in HTTP client or Axios to make API requests to fetch weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

**2. Django Backend with MongoDB (40 minutes):**

   - Set up Django's REST framework in your project to create RESTful API endpoints.
   - Define a Django model for storing weather data. Ensure the model fields align with the data you'll receive from the weather API.
   - Create an API view that receives location requests from the Vue.js frontend, fetches weather data from the API, and stores it in the MongoDB database.
   - Implement another API view to retrieve weather data from MongoDB and send it to the frontend.

   - Implement another API view to retrieve weather data from MongoDB and send it to the frontend.

**3. Frontend-Backend Integration (20 minutes):**

   - Connect the Vue.js frontend to the Django backend by making HTTP requests to the Django API endpoints you created.
   - Implement data dinding to display weather information on the frontend.

**4. Testing (15 minutes):**

   - Test your weather application locally to ensure that it fetches and displays weather data correctly for user-specified locations.
   - Debug and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

**5. Deployment (5 minutes):**

   - Deploy your Vue.js frontend and Django backend separately on platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel. Ensure you configure CORS correctly to allow communication between the two.

**6. Documentation and Cleanup (5 minutes):**

   - Write a README file explaining how to use and run your weather application.
   - Remove unnecessary code or files to keep the project clean.

**Total Estimated Time: 2 Hours**

Please note that this is a simplified guide, and the actual time may vary based on your familiarity with the technologies and your coding speed. For a production-level application with more features, additional time and considerations are necessary.
